##  Rebuild version of the flamelet model for OpenFOAM 2.2.x

The libraries you can use here are generated by Alberto Cuoci and his team. For more information have a look at the official website http://creckmodeling.chem.polimi.it/

## Introduction

I worked with the flamelet tool over 8 month now (masterthesis) and analysed the whole thermomodel and the flamelet extraction libraries. For that I made some validations and compared the results with ANSYS-CFX and measurements. There were some "bugs" in the original version which are removed in this version.

## Compilation

Go into your $FOAM_RUN folder:

<code>cd $FOAM_RUN</code>

<code>cd ../</code>

<code>git clone https://github.com/shor-ty/flameletModel-2.2.x.git</code>

<code>cd flameletModel-2.2.x/thermophysicalModels/flameletExtraction/common</code>

<code>wmake libso</code>

<code>cd ../flamelets/turbulent/</code>

<code>wmake libso</code>

<code>cd ../../../basic/</code>

<code>wmake libso</code>

<code>cd ../../applications/solvers/combustion/flameletSimpleFoam</code>

<code>wmake</code>

<code>cd ../../../../</code>

<code>cp -r tutorials $FOAM_RUN/flameletTutorials</code>


## Changes | Features | Documentation
+ Have a look into the documentation folder

## Important | Validation

+ the rebuild flamelet model for OpenFOAM 2.2.x is validated with a free-stream flame (SANDIA CO/H2/N2 - FLAME A) 
+ for complex burning chambers the tool generates physical results but there is no warranty of the quantity accuracy avaiable
+ further more I give no warranty of my modifications and changes in the tool

## Notice | Warranty
+ I give no warranty of the results you get with that model.

## Older versions
+ the modifyed version of 2.1.x can be found here: https://github.com/shor-ty/flameletModel-2.1.x
